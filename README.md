This repository contains the translation files of the [Unchecky](http://unchecky.com/) program and website.

Submitting a translation
========================

If you are familiar with GitHub, the most straightforward way of submitting a translation is by creating a pull request.

If you aren't, you can simply [download](https://github.com/unchecky/unchecky-translate/archive/master.zip) the files and [contact me](http://unchecky.com/contact) with your translation.

Ampersand (&) perfixes in program translation
=============================================

Some of the strings in the program language files contain the ampersand (&) symbol ([example](https://github.com/unchecky/unchecky-translate/blob/7dd7c73a710ca0543cfb1351b595e6bdfd3b2c21/program/English%20%28United%20States%29/app.txt#L7)).

The ampersand (&) symbol is used to designate an accelerator key. You can read more about it [here](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/261320).

While translating, you can omit the ampersand symbols, but keeping them in your translation will ease the usage of Unchecky in your language.
